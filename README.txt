The time and cost going into making video games is really high. During the beginning stage of the video game production cycle, if we are able to determine how the video game could potentially be received by observing previous releases of similar video games, it would help in altering ideas for the development team. We will be taking into consideration the scores, tags, genres, release time, etc of the games in dataset to help come to a conclusion about how the hypothesised game will be received. The idea also involves analysis of synopsis of the test game with similar games to see how it could possibly be received but it will be developed down the line.
